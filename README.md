# Artisan
### Making writing code generation operations easier

Artisan provides an easy to digest and read format that is both extensible and provides for the flexibility
needed to simplify and write code generation operations for the java programming language.

Artisan is built upon different modules you can read more about the modules in the `README.md` of each module.
For brevity they will be listed here:
- artisan-core shared utilities used in both the format and extensions module. This module is required for
any module of artisan to run.
- [artisan-format](artisan-format/README.md) the format module focused on tokenization and basic syntax
- [artisan-extensions](artisan-extensions/README.md) the extensions module, which implements the artisan-format
